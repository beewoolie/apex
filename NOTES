=======================
Apex -- Arm Boot Loader
NOTES
=======================

Goals

  o Simple structure
  o Memory image may be directly written to flash
  o Use of tables of pointers to handle features, commands, drivers
  o Driver self-discovery when relevent
  o Small image, less than 16K for basic loader
  o Reasonably configurable at ./configure time
  o Good command line support
  o Code sharing among targets is *not* of the highest priority
  o No assembler files
  o No external dependencies aside from a tool chain
  o Staged execution
  o Support for over-the-wire and NAND booting--teeny tiny bootstrap
  o Multiple targets
  o May execute from FLASH, XIP
  o Stack storage will be required

  o IO descriptor: "device:path"
    o "nor:@0x44000000#0x20000"
    o "nand:@0#0x20000"
    o "serial:xmodem", "serial:binary"
    o "eeprom:"
    o allows drivers to handle details of transfers
      o copy "nor:@0x44000000#0x20000" to "mem:@0x20000000"
      o copy "tftp://192.168.8.1/zImage" to "mem:@0x20000000"
      o copy "http://192.168.8.1/zImage" to "nor:@0"
      o erase "nor:@0#0x200000"

  o devices are self descriptive to the extent that they can be in
    terms of erase block sizes and so on

Staged Execution

  o Essential initialization, SDRAM, memory controller, IO multiplexing
  o Move loader into storage for execution, if necessary.  May involve
    transfer from secondary medium: serial, NAND flash, serial eeprom
  o Finish hardware initialization
  o Setup stack
  o Clear BSS
  o Command loop

Configuration parameters

  o Initial base address (may not be necessary)
  o Execution base address
  o Base RAM address for 4K stack, data, BSS
  o Layout of SDRAM memory


Parameters

  o APEX_STACK - Linker calculated top of stack
  o APEX_LMA_START - Load memory address for start loader image
  o APEX_LMA_END - Load memory address for end of loader image
  o APEX_VMA_START - Execution (virtual) memory address for image
  o APEX_BSS_START - Linker calculated start of BSS region
  o APEX_BSS_END - Linker calculated End of BSS region

Symbols

  o init () - driver initialization and then loader exec () 
  o reset () - initial entry point
  o exception_error () - function called for unused exceptions
  o relocate_apex () - move loader into RAM from...whereever 
  o initialize_bootstrap () - pre-relocate initialization
  o initialize_target () - completion of target (non-driver) initialization
  o setup_c () - prepare C exection environment

Drivers

  o read/write, block/byte
  o erase
  o status/info
  o init/detect

Basic commands

  o display
  o verify
  o checksum
  o copy
  o boot (linux kernel)
  o go (arbitrary execution)
  o printenv/setenv

Sections

  o .entry - guaranteed first section.  Should contain only one symbol
  o .bootstrap - guaranteed to follow .entry.  Smallest possible
    section of code to handle bootstrap into RAM, if necessary
  o .text - rest of loader code
  o .init - initialization hooks, especially drivers
  o .env - environment hooks
  o .exit - hooks to call before leaving loader
  o .cmd - command functions
  o .bss - BSS
  o .data - initialized data

Configuration

  CONFIG_ARM - ARM target
  CONFIG_LH7952X
  CONFIG_LH79520
  CONFIG_LH79524
  CONFIG_LPD79520
  CONFIG_LPD79524
  CONFIG_LH7A40X
  CONFIG_LH7A400
  CONFIG_LH7A404
  CONFIG_LPD7A400
  CONFIG_LPD7A404
  CONFIG_CONSOLE_DEVICE - Defines which serial (or other) device is console

Kernel Build Scripts

 o The directory Makefiles may be invoked in two different situations.
   Actually, only the primary one, for the architecture, is like that.
   It may be included in the top-level Makefile in which case it is
   used to configure how the kernel will be built.  It may then be
   invoked as a Makefile used to build targets in that directory.  This
   can be confusing when it needs to define targets that must not
   override the default for the top-level Makefile.  The kernel doesn't
   need to worry about this, I believe, because it does not depend on
   the arch/$(ARCH) directory to build a target necessary for the
   vmlinux file.  Instead, it only calls arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile to build
   boot targets.
