APEX Boot Loader
 Release Notes
================

The APEX boot loader has been designed to be small, efficient, and
easy to extend.  It uses some code and the build system form the Linux
kernel.  There are pieces of code taken from BLOB and UBoot as well.


  Building APEX
  -------------

Near the top of the root Makefile is the declaration of the
cross-compiler path.  This must be set to point to the prefix for the
cross compiling toolchain, unless you are building from an ARM
platform.  For example,

  CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/arm-linux/gcc-3.4.1-glibc-2.3.3/bin/arm-linux-

In this first release, the only target that may be build is the
LPD79524.

  # make lpd79524_config

After executing this command, there will be a link in the root
directory called 'config' that points to the configuration file for
the target.  This file may be modified to change which features to
include or exclude.  

APEX uses the Linux kernel build scripts so that rebuilding is
(nearly) optimal.  Changes to the configuration are automatically
propagated such that only affected source files are rebuilt.

  # make

The ELF format binary, apex, will be put into the root directory.  To
generate a dumped binary, build the apex.bin target.

  # make apex.bin

This dumped file is src/arc-arm/rom/apex.bin.


  Running APEX
  ------------

APEX is designed to start from any address and to relocate itself when
necessary.  If the binary is small enough (less than 16KiB), it may be
copied to the internal SRAM of the LH79524 and executed from there.
