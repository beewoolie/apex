APEX Boot Loader
 Release Notes
================

The APEX boot loader has been designed to be small, efficient, and
easy to extend.  It uses some code and the build system form the Linux
kernel.  There are pieces of code taken from BLOB and UBoot as well.


  Supported Targets
  -----------------

The loader is fully functional for the LPD79524, LPD7A400, LPD7A404.
It builds for the LPD79520, but there is presently no version of the
Linux kernel that recognizes the correct architecture number.


  Building APEX
  -------------

Near the top of the root Makefile is the declaration of the
cross-compiler path.  This must be set to point to the prefix for the
cross compiling toolchain, unless you are building from an ARM
platform.  For example,

  CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/arm-linux/gcc-3.4.1-glibc-2.3.3/bin/arm-linux-

To build for the LPD79524:

  # make lpd79524_config

After executing this command, there will be a link in the root
directory called 'config' that points to the configuration file for
the LPD79524.  This file may be modified to include or exclude some
features.

APEX uses the Linux kernel build scripts so that rebuilding is
(nearly) optimal.  Changes to the configuration are automatically
propagated such that only affected source files are rebuilt.  It isn't
as optimal as the kernel because it lacks the fancy config splitter
that kbuild executes.  This will be implemented, eventually.

  # make

The ELF format binary, apex, as well as the dumped
src/arch-arm/rom/apex.bin will be put into the root directory.  To
generate a dumped binary, build the apex.bin target.


  Running APEX
  ------------

APEX is designed to start from any address and to relocate itself when
necessary.  If the binary is small enough (less than 16KiB), it may be
copied to the internal SRAM of the LH79524 and executed from there.
