   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   The macros here are for accessing registers and functions of the
   standard CP15 coprocessor.  These registers control the MMU and
   cache functions of most ARM microprocessors.

   Standard MACROS are here that will tend to be a superset of those
   supported by any given core.  Be careful to #undef macros that are
   not available on a given architecture.
