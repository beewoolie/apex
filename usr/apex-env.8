.SH NAME
apex-env \- user-mode access to APEX flash environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apex-env
COMMAND
[
.B ARGS ...
]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBapex-env\fR is a utility for viewing and modifying the environment
used by the APEX Boot Loader to define how the system will boot.  APEX
has a predefined set of environment variables, defined by the
build-time configuration, that control operation of the boot loader.  

Embedded in the APEX image is a linking structure that \fBapex-env\fR
uses to identify the boot loader image and to locate information about
the environment variables as well as the flash region that holds the
user-modified values.  If APEX is built without enabling this
user-modifiable flash region, \fBapex-env\fR will only allow the user
to browse the variables and the default values.

\fBapex-env\fR depends on the \fI/dev/mtd\fR driver to locate the
APEX.  It first looks for a partition named 'Loader', but it will also
check the first partition in case APEX is used as the primary boot
loader.

.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.I "describe [KEY]"
Displays a description of KEY or descriptions of every environment
variable is KEY is omitted.

.TP
.I "dump"
Displays the contents of the flash environment region in a
hexadecimal/ASCII format useful for troubleshooting.

.TP
.I "eraseenv"
Clear the environment region by setting all of the bytes to 0xff.
Use this command with care.  Assuming that APEX was properly built for
your system, it still relies on the caching feature of the MTD block
driver to modify only a portion of a flash eraseblock.  Be mindful
that interrupting this command after the block is erased and before
the important data has been restored could render the system
unbootable.

.TP
.I "printenv [KEY]"
Displays the value of KEY or the values of every environment variable
if KEY is omitted.  The separator between the key and the value is =*
for default values or just = when the default value has been
overridden by a value saved in the flash environment.

.TP
.I "setenv KEY VALUE"
Overrides the default value of KEY with VALUE.  Use quoting to prevent
the shell from splitting VALUE into separate words and from
interpolation.  

.TP
.I "unsetenv KEY"
Restores the default value of KEY by marking any value stored in flash
as deleted.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
apex-env printenv
Show all of the environment variables and the current values for each.

.TP
apex-env setenv startup 'copy $kernelsrc $bootaddr ; boot'
Change the startup variable to copy the kernel and immediately boot.

.TP
apex-env dump | head
Examine the first few bytes of the raw environment data.
