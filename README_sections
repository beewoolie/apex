================
APEX Boot Loader
README_sections
================

Much of the organization of the APEX binary image is controlled by the
linker script and sections therein.  This has become sufficiently
complex such that documentation specific to the linker sections is
necessary to make sense of it.

o Bootstrap organization needs to account for functions such as
  udelay().  Probably these can go at the end of the bootstrap block and
  the exit routine will jump over them.

o Preinitialization for relocation should be clearly placed.
