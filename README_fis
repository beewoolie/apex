===========================
     APEX Boot Loader
       FIS Driver
===========================

This README explains some of the features and implementation details
of the FIS driver.  FIS is also sometimes called the RedBoot partition
format.  This driver supports the flash partition format with an
extension that allows targets to more easily be upgraded.


Underlying Region
-----------------

The CONFIG_DRIVER_FIS_BLOCKDEVICE region describes the underlying
region for the FIS partitioned data.  Due to the way that the
partitions map onto flash, this region may only include the driver.
No offset or extent will be used.

As far as I know, FIS is only used on NOR flash, but there is no
reason it couldn't be used on NAND flash.  As such, there is little
reason for the underlying driver to be anything but "nor:".


Skip Descriptors
----------------

APEX supports an extension to the partition format that describes
portions of flash to be skipped over during IO.
