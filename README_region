================

APEX uses a common notation when describing regions of memory, data
sources, and data sinks.  The form is similar to that used by the
Linux kernel, but it is different in a significant way.

  [DRIVER:][@]START[#LENGTH]

The DRIVER is the name of an IO driver that handles the requests.
Without an explicit driver, the 'memory:' driver is the default.
Driver names may be shortened to a unique prefix.  If there is only
one driver that begins with the letter 'm', then 'm:' uniquely
identifies it.  If there are two nor drivers, APEX will require a
driver name long enough to distinguish which one to use.  The command
'drvinfo' lists the available drivers.

The START address is the beginning of the region relative to the
driver's domain.  In the case of the memory driver, this is the start
of addressable memory.  For other devices such as flash memory, the
first memory location in the device is zero.  Thus, for a flash part
mapped at 0x40000000, nor:0 to the first byte at physical address
0x40000000.

The LENGTH is a count of bytes.  It may be omitted when the length is
either self-evident or when there is a reasonable default.  For
example, when displaying a region, the default length is about 64.
When erasing a flash block, the default length is 1.

START and LENGTH may be specifed as a decimal number, a hexadecimal
number, and may followed by a suffix 'm' or 'k' for megabytes
(1024*1024) or kilobytes (1024).

  nor:16k#4k	 - 4096 bytes, 16384 bytes from the start of NOR flash
  nand:0	 - The only NAND driver
  nand-eb501:0   - A specific NAND driver
