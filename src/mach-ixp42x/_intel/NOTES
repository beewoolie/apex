NOTES
-----

  o Most of the constants we need are available.  The QManager is one
    that is iomapped, according to the registers header.  We'll have
    to do something about this.
  o Other missing constants:
    o IX_OSAL_STATIC_MAP
    o IX_OSAL_BE
    o IX_OSAL_LE_DC
    o IX_OSAL_LE_AC
    o IX_OSAL_DYNAMIC_MAP
  o libosal should build once this is resolved

  o We're using a copy of the header for now.  There must be links
    made for the asm and arch directories.
