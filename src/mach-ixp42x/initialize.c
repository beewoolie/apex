   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   Hardware initializations for the ixp42x.  Some initializations may
   be left to drivers, such as the serial interface and timer.

   The COPROCESSOR_WAIT macro comes from redboot.  It isn't clear to
   me that we need to do this, though the cache and tlb flushing might
   require it.

/* usleep

   this function accepts a count of microseconds and will wait at
   least that long before returning.  The base counter rate is
   66.66MHz or a 15ns cycle time.  1us takes 67 counts.

   The 32 bit counter wraps after about 64s.

   Note that this function is neither __naked nor static.  It is
   available to the rest of APEX.

   The return value is true if SDRAM has been initialized and false if
   this initialization has already been performed.  Note that the
   non-SDRAM initializations are performed regardless of whether or
   not we're running in SDRAM.
