   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   Implementation of APEX relocator that copies the loader from I2C
   EEPROM or SD/MMC depending on our needs.  This function will
   override the default version that is part of the architecture
   library.

   Bootstrap Loader Selection
   --------------------------

   There are three ways in which this APEX binary may be loaded.  We
   attempt to make sense of each of them.

   Production always depends on the I2C EEPROM to get the system on
   it's feet.  The CPU ROM copies the first 4K from EEPROM to
   0xb0000000 and jumps to the first instruction.  At that point, we
   may want to either read the whole loader from EEPROM and continue
   execution at the same instruction in SDRAM, or we may want to read
   the loader from an SD/MMC card.  The third way we may want to run
   APEX is to copy it into SRAM (via JTAG) and run that version
   without accessing the EEPROM or SD/MMC.

   Distinguishing between the first two cases may be possible using a
   unique FAT partition table layout that signals to the loader that a
   better version of APEX resides there.

   The third case is a little trickier since we don't have a good way
   to know if we only have 4K of the loader, copied from EEPROM, or a
   whole copy of the loader in SRAM.  Unless we implement some sort of
   checksum operation, we'll probably not be able to do this.  Until
   that time, we'll probably depend on a second entry point to signal
   that the loader is already all present and a simple copy from where
   it is desired.

   Relocating APEX from SD/MMC
   ---------------------------

   Relocation of APEX from SD/MMC has several elements.  The first 4K
   of the loader are copied from I2C memory to address 0xb0000000 by
   the CPU Boot ROM.  The relocate_apex () implementation here is
   guaranteed to be able to execute from that section of the program.

   The relocator reads the partition table of the SD card.  If it
   finds that the first partition is type 0, it reads 80K - 7K (4K
   for the code from I2C, 2K for stack, and 1K for data), from that
   partition to address 0xb0000000+4k and jumps to it.  This
   guarantees that the loader, as read from SD/MMC, is able fully
   initialize the system including SDRAM as needed.

   If a larger boot loader is needed, the temporary stack may be
   relocated to SDRAM, allowing for another 4K of boot loader code.
