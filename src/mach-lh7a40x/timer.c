   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   There isn't a good timing source available on the LH7A40X CPUs.  We
   satisfy ourselves with a 16 bit, 2KHz timer that does some
   primitive checking for the timer wrapping.  This works as long as
   the interval between reads is less than half of the period of the
   timer, or 15 seconds.  This turns out to be an OK assumption since
   the timer tends to be used for checking very short timeout values.
