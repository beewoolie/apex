/* Static Memory Controller
   ------------------------

   In order to better support user needs WRT static memory regions, we
   do not change the default timing or alignment for any of the the
   SMC regions.  This means the reading from flash, for example, will
   be slow.  However, it does mean the greatest compatibility.

/* Notes
   -----

   According to the Sharp LH7A400 user's guide, SDRAM initialization
   goes like this.  

   1) Wait 100us for device power to stabilize.  This isn't really a
      problem since we need to wait a couple of seconds for wakeup.
   2) Program SDRC mode registers for each chip select region
   3) Send NOP command.
   4) Wait 200us or another period according to the device datasheet.
   5) Program device mode register
   6) Set the refresh timer to 10 for a 10 HCLK refresh cycle
   7) Wait for eight refresh periods
   8) Reprogram refresh timer
   9) Program SDRAM mode registers
  10) Program the SDRC mode registers according to device mode
      register programming.
  11) Program initialize and MRS to 0 and set to GBLCFG for normal
      operation.  

   According to the LH7A400 EVB start code, here's what we need to do:

   1) Make sure CPU is in the correct mode, SVC32, etc.
   2) Initialize multiplexed pins
   3) Initialize clocks
   4) Initialize memory controllers
   5) Put CPU in SVC mode (or whatever)

   Micron SDRAM can be be initialized with this simple sequence.
   JEDEC is the same except that the wait is 200us and there are at least
   8 AUTO-REFRESH commands.  Changing to the JEDEC way only requires
   lengthening the delays. 

   1) Apply power
   2) Wait 100us while applying NOP/COMMAND INHIBIT
   3) PRECHARGE ALL
   4) AUTO-REFRESH *2, more is OK
   5) LOAD MODE

   For the delay, we use one of the system timers.

/* CONFIG_SDRAM_CONTIGUOUS - This bit changes the way that the SDRAM
   controller maps SDRAM to physical addresses.  In systems with 32MiB
   of RAM, this will make it contguous.  In systems with more memory,
   the memory is not all contiguous though it is supposed to be
   accessible. */

/* usleep

   this function accepts a count of microseconds and will wait at
   least that long before returning.  It depends on the timer being
   setup.

   Note that this function is neither __naked nor static.  It is
   available to the rest of the application as is.

   The fundamental timer frequency is 508469 Hz which is a period of
   1.9667us.  The rounding (us - us/2) means that the value cannot
   round to zero.  The compiler is efficient and can make the roundoff
   in a single instruction.
