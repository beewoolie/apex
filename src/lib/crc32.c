   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   An original reference for information about implementating CRC32 is
   a document written by Ross Williams in 1993, "A Painless Guide to
   CRC Error Detection Algorithms."  Using his nomenclature, the CRC
   algorithm implemented by Ethernet and Zip compression has the
   following features:

     Width  : 32
     Poly   : 04C11DB7
     iPoly  : EDB88320		// reverse bit order
     Init   : FFFFFFFF
     RefIn  : True
     RefOut : True
     XorOut : FFFFFFFF
     Check  : CBF43926

   Width parameter is the length, in bits, of the polynomial.  The
   Poly is a bit mask indicating which terms have non-zero
   coefficients.  In this case, 

     g(x) = x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 +
            x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1

   Init is value used to initialize the CRC function.  RefIn and
   RefOut, being true, indicate that the algorithm interprets the MSB
   of each byte as an MSB.  XorOut is the XOR mask applied to the CRC
   on completion.  Check is the CRC for the sequence "123456789".

   The implementation used herein comes from BLOB and was the work of
   several people, Erik Muow, Jan-Derk Bakker, and Russell King.  It
   was found to be faster than the table algorithm though a little
   larger, ~124 bytes.

/* compute_crc32

   calculates a standard 32 bit CRC checksum over a sequence of bytes.
   This implementation is optimized for the ARM architecture.  Other
   architectures, e.g. i386 will probably not be well served by this
   version as it depends on excellent optimization by the compiler as
   well as a adequate number of registers.
