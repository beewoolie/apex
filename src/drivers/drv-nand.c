   -----------
   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   NAND flash driver.

   Unlike the NOR driver, this one hasn't received the same attention
   for reducing code size.  It is probably amenable to the same
   optimizations.  However, since it already much smaller than the NOR
   driver, there isn't the same incentive to optimize.

   Status
   ------

   (1<<0) Program/erase error
   (1<<6) Ready
   (1<<7) !R/O
