   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   Implementation of APEX relocator that copies the loader from
   OneNAND flash into SDRAM.  This function will override the default
   version that is part of the architecture library.  Note that we
   *still* have to cope with the possibility that we're running from
   SDRAM and so we need to relocate within memory.  Thus, we play
   nice.

   o DataBuffer0/DataBuffer1.  In APEX, we don't really care about
     which data buffer we use to access the NAND flash.  This
     relocation code uses DataBuffer0 so that we can get more than 1K
     of the boot loader into contiguous memory before SDRAM is
     initialized.

   o Preinitialization.  In order to get a 3k boot loader image, load
     the second and third KiB from NAND flash into DataRam0.  See the
     comment on the preinitialization function for details.

/* relocate_early

   performs a crucial preload of the second and third KiB of APEX into
   DataRAM0.  This allows us to run with 3KiB of boot loader code
   until we get the SDRAM initialized and the whole loader copied to
   SDRAM.

   Note that we always perform this preinitialization because it
   cannot hurt and it is cheaper to just execute the load than deal
   with trying to figure out where APEX is executing.  We already can
   be sure that the OneNAND flash is available.

   relocates the loader from either OneNAND flash or from SDRAM to the

   piece of code to perform the check because it may require some
   other technique to determine the boot mode.
