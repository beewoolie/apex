   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   FIS is a partition driver.  It parses flash image descriptors in an
   underlying region as files of a sort.  It is similar to the
   filesystem drivers in this way.

   IXP42X in LE Mode
   -----------------

     This Xscale processor does some shenanigans with byte & half-word
     swapping when it is in little-endian mode.  A flash part which
     was configured for a big-endian system doesn't read correctly
     when the CPU is in little-endian mode.  For the most part, this
     is handled by the NOR flash driver.

     The FIS driver needs to cope in that the data in the partition
     table will be ordered for big-endian consumption.  The strings
     will be OK because of the NOR flash driver's efforts.  However
     the start and length values will be BE and must be swapped for
     LE.

     This conversion is done by reading all of the partition entries,
     looking for the partition table's own entry.  When it is found,
     the driver checks the length of the block for a match with the
     NOR flash erase block size.  If there is a match when the data is
     swapped, it is assumed that the system is reading a BE partition
     table.

     For simplicity and general correctness, this is done every time
     this driver activates.  The table could be cached, but it is
     possible that the underlying block driver region is changed
     between invocations.  So, the easy solution is to read through
     the table twice: once to determine the endian-ness and a second
     time looking for the data we care about.

   Underlying Region
   -----------------

   Due to the way we map form the user's region onto the underlying
   region, this underlying region's offset and length are ignored.  We
   certainly could add it in, but the FIS structures don't let this
   make sense.  Unless our needs change, this is a fine assumption.
   All we really care about is finding the real flash driver for that
   the partition table describes.


   Open Call Pass Through
   ----------------------

   The open call converts the fis driver descriptor into a descriptor
   that points to the partition using the source driver.  Due to the
   fact that that partition table is physically addressed, the FIS
   driver has to subtract the base address of the underlying driver
   when passing this through.  Thus, the FIS driver has no
   read/seek/write methods.

   Skip Descriptors
   ----------------

   In order to handle skip descriptors, we need to either process all
   IO through this driver, or we need to pass the skip information to
   the underlying driver.  I think we're better off filtering as that
   makes for the most localized change.  Really, all we need to do is
   pass all IO calls through a simple check for the skipp'd areas and
   go from there.  This also means that the skip descriptors are a
   global resource as we may have more than one descriptor open.

   There is a short path that ignores the skip data if none of the
   open descriptors has any.

   Also, we can only handle one partition with skips at a time.  This
   ought not cause problems since it is really just a crutch for
   reading data from a partition.  The maximum number of skips per
   partition is determined by a static array that holds the skip data.

   It is important that the skip descriptors are sorted so that we
   don't have to pass through the descriptors more than once when
   performing each cycle through fis_read.  We really have two tasks.
   We want to determine which descriptors preceed the current IO
   position and we want to know if there is a descriptor that follows
   the current IO position that truncates the contiguous IO block.
   This could be done in two passes, but with a sort, it can be done
   in one.  Sort is available as long as the user sorts commands.
   Moreover, this is a driver that is used on a system that doesn't
   seem to need a SMALL version.
