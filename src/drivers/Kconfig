config DRIVER_FAT
	bool "FAT Filesystem"
	select USES_PATHNAME_PARSER
	default n
	help
	  This driver implements a FAT filesystem driver.

config DRIVER_FAT_BLOCKDEVICE
	string "Underlying driver region"
	depends on DRIVER_FAT
	default "cf"
	help
	  The filesystem driver is staticly links to an underlying
	  driver/region for access to the media.  Set that region
	  here.  A later update to the filesystem code will let the
	  user specify this region dynamically. 
	

config DRIVER_EXT2
	bool "EXT2 Filesystem"
	select USES_PATHNAME_PARSER
	default n
	help
	  This driver implements an Ext2 filesystem driver.

config DRIVER_EXT2_BLOCKDEVICE
	string "Underlying driver region"
	depends on DRIVER_EXT2
	default "cf"
	help
	  The filesystem driver is staticly links to an underlying
	  driver/region for access to the media.  Set that region
	  here.  A later update to the filesystem code will let the
	  user specify this region dynamically. 
	

config DRIVER_JFFS2
	bool "JFFS2 Filesystem"
	select USES_PATHNAME_PARSER
	default n
	help
	  This driver implements a JFFS2 filesystem driver.

config DRIVER_JFFS2_BLOCKDEVICE
	string "Underlying driver region"
	depends on DRIVER_JFFS2
	default ""
	help
	  The filesystem driver is staticly links to an underlying
	  driver/region for access to the media.  Set that region
	  here.  A later update to the filesystem code will let the
	  user specify this region dynamically. 


config DRIVER_NOR_CFI
	bool "CFI NOR Flash"
	depends on USES_NOR_CFI=y
	default y
	help
	  This driver implements a CFI compliant NOR flash driver
	  which works with most contemporary NOR flash chips. 

config DRIVER_NOR_CFI_NO_BUFFERED
	bool "Inhibit Buffered Writes"
	depends on DRIVER_NOR_CFI
	default n
	help
	  This option disables the buffered write code in the CFI NOR
	  flash driver.  APEX is built with only one CFI flash write
	  routine.  If the target has flash without a write buffer,
	  this option must be used to force the driver to include the
	  slower, unbuffered write code.

	  Leave this option set to 'N' unless your target is
	  experiencing problems using the buffered write routine.

config DRIVER_COMPACTFLASH
	bool "CompactFlash"
	depends on USES_COMPACTFLASH=y
	default n
	help
	  This driver implements a CompactFlash driver for the target
	  platform.

config DRIVER_SMC91X
	bool "SMC91X Integrated Ethernet"
	depends on USES_SMC91X
	select USE_ETHERNET
	default y
	help
	  This driver initializes and activates the SMSC SMC91x
	  Ethernet controller.
