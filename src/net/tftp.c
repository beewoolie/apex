   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   The tftp descriptor looks like this:

     tftp://host/path
   or
     tftp:/path using a default host of $server, perhaps.
   

  NOTES
  -----

   o The meshing o the tftp protocol and data handling within APEX is
     a bit more complex that would be ideal.  tftp only considers
     streams of bytes to be accessible linearly from the start to the
     end.  There is no seeking.  There is a timeout on each block, so
     APEX cannot hold off indefinitely with continuing the stream
     transfer.  The only flow control that APEX can assert when
     reading files is to throttle the acknowlegements.  So, what it
     shall do is request the first block.  Let the next layer read
     data from the buffered data and wait for the whole block to be
     consumed before acknowledging that the block was received.  
   o Performance may be improved by caching one or more data blocks
     and allowing there to be a sliding window of available data.
     This could, potentially, allow for a reasonable overlap of
     requests and processing.  Especially if APEX is performing some
     sort of transformation on the data, e.g. checksum or writing to
     flash.  For transfers to memory, there is probably little to be
     gained with a sliding window.  However, this driver doesn't know
     how the data will be used.
   o We need to select a random port number.  We need to see if there
     is some place where we can sample semi-random data.  At least so
     that we have a chance to detect out-dated connections.  Or, we
     can let this be a problem for the udp layer.
