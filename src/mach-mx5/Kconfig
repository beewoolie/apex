	  ramdisk.  The kernel command line and the APEX startup
	  commands may be overridden to perform the same steps.

	  There is a separate option in the Environment section that
	  controls whether or not APEX copies the ramdisk from flash
	  into RAM at startup.  That is where the ramdisk region is
	  defined.

config RAMDISK_LMA

	  For most targets, CPU info is a simple report of the
