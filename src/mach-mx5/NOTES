o 2011.jul.02
  o B3.12 CP15 registers for VMSA implementation, p B3-64 p1337 (really), p1339

  o Questions unanswered
    o What is the encoding for cp15 c9 wrt. Level 2 cache?
    o What is the PLATFORM block?  It's used to initialize some clock
      dividers.  There is a field called ICGC to set the dividers and
      it is set to 0x725 on our Efika and 0x124 on the EVK.
    o What is cp15 c0 c1 2,  L1NEON bit set based on ARM errata?
    o Where are the AIPS[0] and AIPS[4] registers documented?

  o watchdog should be a peripheral.  I suppose we could be paranoid
    and want to get it enabled really early, but what is the point?
    We're going to have more obvious problems if something in the very
    early setup fails.  Putting watchdog in a peripheral/service makes
    for nice modularity.
