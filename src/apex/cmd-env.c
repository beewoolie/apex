   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   Code to handle an environment.  The application can maintain a
   persistent environment in flash with key/value pairs.  These
   routines read and write the environment.  It is possible
   (improbably) that an environment may be maintained within eeprom
   (~128B) where there will be some adjustment to the algorithms.
   Perhaps the most likely variation will be to limit the keys to a
   predefined set.

   Some likely environment keywords are

     cmdline		   - Default kernel command line
     autoboot		   - Set to non-zero to boot automatically
     autoboot_timeout	   - number of milliseconds before autoboot-ing


   TODO
   ----

   - Seems reasonable to aggregate the keys into an array and leave
     them out of flash since we can only use environment keys that are
     already defined within the program.
   - The previous change also means that we could get rid of the
     length from the marker and put the key ID in there.  The size of
     each entry shall be determined by the presence of a null byte.
     This is no worse (and really much better) than adding a length to
     the header.
   - The environment variables could come from initializations in the
     code.  Each module that wants variables would call here to
     register them.  The indices for each would be transparent since
     the caller would always pass/receive strings.  Moreover, the
     environment would only be valid with the version of the firmware
     that created it.   It would be handy to use special initializers
     to define and reference these keys.  There should be a checksum
     at the top of the environment that make it impossible to load the
     values incorrectly.
   - Setup should come from the lds file and the board configuration.
   - With the from an array, we could probably put the environment
     into EEPROM.
