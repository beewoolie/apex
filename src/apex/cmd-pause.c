   -----------
   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   This function should never be included in production builds.  It's
   available for testing timers.  A general purpose pause command
   would be welcome, one that accepts a timeout parameter.


   NOTES
   -----

   o Should modify this to allow for a parameter to control which
     timer and the interval.
