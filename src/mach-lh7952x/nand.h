/* The NAND address map converts the boot code from the CPU into the
   number of address bytes used by the device.  Refer to the LH79524
   documentation for the boot codes.  The map is a 32 bit number where
   each boot code is represented by two bits.  Boot code zero occupies
   the least significant bits of the map.  The values in the map are 0
   for non-NAND boot, 1 for 3 address bytes, 2 for 4 address bytes,
   and 3 for five address bytes.  The simple decode macro will return
   2 for non-NAND boot codes.

   The reason for this is two-fold.  First, we want to be space
   efficient when we can.  This stragety yields a correct result in
   only a few instructions.  Second, a lookup using a byte array is
   infeasible when the loader is still trying to get itself into
   SDRAM.  The compiler wants to put the array into constant storage
   and not in the code segment.  Most importantly, though, this method
   is compact.
