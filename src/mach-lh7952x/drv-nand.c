   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   NAND flash IO driver for LPD 79524.

   Unlike the NOR driver, this one hasn't received the same attention
   for reducing code size.  It is probably amenable to the same
   optimizations.  However, since it already much smaller than the NOR
   driver, there isn't the same incentive to optimize.

   There are two modes that this driver can operate in.  The default,
   !CONFIG_NAND_LPD adheres to the SHARP design for using A22 and A23
   to control the nOE and nWE signals.  This mode ought to work
   regardless of whether or not the system has an LPD CPLD chip.  The
   CONFIG_NAND_LPD mode is more efficient because the CPLD controls
   the NAND nCE signal and the A22 and A23 address lines can be used
   as address lines.  The SHARP design may impose restrictions on
   systems designed to require these higher order address lines.
