Description: Boot Loader for Embedded Systems
 The APEX Boot Loader is a modular and retargetable firmware loader
 suitable for embedded systems.  It may be used for the first (and
 only) stage of the boot process, or as a second stage when it is
 desirable to retain the manufacturers boot loader.
 . 
 The APEX command line offers a comfortable (e.g. command line editing
 and history) and extensible platform for development and production
 uses.
