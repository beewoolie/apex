apex (1.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the sort comparison function in the fis driver so that the skips
    are ordered by offset address. 
  * Changed the default startup to copy from fis://kernel and
    fis://ramdisk.  We no longer expect there to be SERCOMM headers on the
    kernel or ramdisk images.  Freedom.

apex (1.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

    by SERCOMM headers to cope with RedBoot shortcomings.
