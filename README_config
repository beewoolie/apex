Configuration Macros
--------------------

CONFIG_ARCH (string)

  Name of the architecture.  Presently, only 'arm' is supported.
  There is a directory src/arch-$(CONFIG_ARCH) that controls the
  architecture. 

CONFIG_ARCH_$(CONFIG_ARM) (y/n)

  Defined as 'y' in order to allow the Makefiles to conditionally
  compile source files.

CONFIG_MACH_* (y/n)

  Machine or board-level configuration.  This allows for
  board-specific initialization and drivers.

CONFIG_APEX_VMA (hex)

  Virtual memory address of APEX when it runs.  This is really a
  physical address, but it is still separate from the load address.

CONFIG_KERNEL_LMA (hex)

  Linux kernel execution address.  This is the location where a
  kernel is copied and where the loader passes execution control when
  booting.

CONFIG_MEM_BANK[0-3]_START (hex)
CONFIG_MEM_BANK[0-3]_LENGTH (hex)

  Declaration of the SDRAM banks.  This is used used search for memory
  to pass to the kernel.

CONFIG_SPINNER (y/n)
 
  Declare as y to enable a progress feedback spinner while the loader
  performs time consuming tasks.

CONFIG_CMD_* (y/n)

  Include code to implement specific commands. 

CONFIG_CMD_CHECKSUM (y/n)

  Command computes a CRC32 over a region.

CONFIG_CMD_COPY (y/n)

  Command copies from one region to another.

CONFIG_CMD_DUMP (y/n)

  Command shows the contents of a region on the console.

CONFIG_CMD_DRVINFO (y/n)

  Command shows a list of active region IO drivers.

CONFIG_CMD_ENV (y/n)

  Command enables a non-volatile, user editable environment.

CONFIG_CMD_ERASE (y/n)

  Command erases a region.

CONFIG_CMD_ERASEENV (y/n)

  Command erases the whole environment. 

CONFIG_CMD_SETENV (y/n)

  Commands setenv and unsetenv change the contents of the environment.  

CONFIG_CMD_PAUSE (y/n)

  Command pauses for two seconds.

CONFIG_CMD_VERIFY (y/n)

  Command compares regions.

CONFIG_CMD_WAIT (y/n)

  Command pauses a number of tenths of a second before continuing to
  execute commands.  The user may cancel the wait and cancel further
  commands.

CONFIG_CMD_XRECEIVE (y/n)

  Command receives data over the console and saves it to a region.

CONFIG_ATAG (y/n)

  Command includes code to build an ATAG list before booting the
  kernel.

CONFIG_ATAG_PHYS (hex)

  Physical address of the ATAG list.  This feature may change as the
  kernel is already being given a pointer to the ATAG list at boot
  time.

CONFIG_ARCH_NUMBER (number)

  The ARM architecture number passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.

CONFIG_DRIVER_NAND (y/n)

  Include a region IO driver for NAND flash.

CONFIG_DRIVER_NOR (y/n)

  Include a region IO driver for NOR flash.

CONFIG_RELOCATE_NAND (y/n)

  Use an APEX relocator that will copy the loader from NAND flash
  instead of relocating it where it starts.  Normally, the loader
  copies itself from NOR flash with a simple memory to memory copy.
  NAND flash requires greater support to move the loader from flash to
  SDRAM.

CONFIG_NAND_LPD (y/n)

  Directly support the LogicPD NAND flash control features.  The
  LogicPD CPLD has slightly control over NAND flash than a bare chip.
  Use this options when building for one of the LPD CardEngines. 

CONFIG_ENV_AUTOBOOT (number)

  Time, in tenths of a second, to let the user intervene before
  automatically autobooting.  A value of zero will perform a boot
  command without letting the user an opportunite to intervene.
  Without this option, the loader will only boot interactively.

CONFIG_ENV_REGION (string)

  String describing the IO region where the environment is stored.  If
  this parameter is present (or if the env_d descriptor is initialized
  elsewhere), the user will be able to make and preserve changes to
  the environment between executions of the loader.  Without an IO
  region, the environment is statically defined at compile time.  E.g.

  CONFIG_ENV_REGION=nor:128k#64k

CONFIG_ENV_REGION_KERNEL (string)

  String describing the IO region where the kernel is stored.  If this
  parameter is present and if there is a CONFIG_KERNEL_VMA, then the
  startup string will include a command to copy the kernel from this
  region to the VMA address.  E.g.
  
  CONFIG_ENV_REGION_KERNEL=nor:256k#1536k

CONFIG_INTERRUPTS (y/n)

  Enables support for handling interrupts within the bootloader.  This
  code may never be completed as it requires that the MMU be
  programmed.
