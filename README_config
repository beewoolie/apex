Configuration Macros
--------------------

CONFIG_ARCH (string)

  Name of the architecture.  Presently, only 'arm' is supported.
  There is a directory src/arch-$(CONFIG_ARCH) that controls the
  architecture. 

CONFIG_ARCH_$(CONFIG_ARM) (y/n)

  Defined as 'y' in order to allow the Makefiles to conditionally
  compile source files.

CONFIG_MACH_* (y/n)

  Machine or board-level configuration.  This allows for
  board-specific initialization and drivers.

CONFIG_APEX_VMA (hex)

  Virtual memory address of APEX when it runs.  This is really a
  physical address, but it is still separate from the load address.

CONFIG_KERNEL_LMA (hex)

  Linux kernel execution address.  This is the location where a
  kernel is copied and where the loader passes execution control when
  booting.

CONFIG_MEM_BANK[0-3]_START (hex)
CONFIG_MEM_BANK[0-3]_LENGTH (hex)

  Declaration of the SDRAM banks.  This is used used search for memory
  to pass to the kernel.

CONFIG_SPINNER (y/n)
 
  Declare as y to enable a progress feedback spinner while the loader
  performs time consuming tasks.

CONFIG_CMD_* (y/n)

  Include code to implement specific commands. 

CONFIG_CMD_CHECKSUM (y/n)

  Command computes a CRC32 over a region.

CONFIG_CMD_COPY (y/n)

  Command copies from one region to another.

CONFIG_CMD_DUMP (y/n)

  Command shows the contents of a region on the console.

CONFIG_CMD_DRVINFO (y/n)

  Command shows a list of active region IO drivers.

CONFIG_CMD_ENV (y/n)

  Command enables a non-volatile, user editable environment.

CONFIG_CMD_ERASE (y/n)

  Command erases a region.

CONFIG_CMD_ERASEENV (y/n)

  Command erases the whole environment. 

CONFIG_CMD_SETENV (y/n)

  Commands setenv and unsetenv change the contents of the environment.  

CONFIG_CMD_PAUSE (y/n)

  Command pauses for two seconds.

CONFIG_CMD_VERIFY (y/n)

  Command compares regions.

CONFIG_CMD_WAIT (y/n)

  Command pauses a number of tenths of a second before continuing to
  execute commands.  The user may cancel the wait and cancel further
  commands.

CONFIG_CMD_XRECEIVE (y/n)

  Command receives data over the console and saves it to a region.

CONFIG_ATAG (y/n)

  Command includes code to build an ATAG list before booting the
  kernel.

CONFIG_ATAG_PHYS (hex)

  Physical address of the ATAG list.  This feature may change as the
  kernel is already being given a pointer to the ATAG list at boot
  time.

CONFIG_ARCH_NUMBER (number)

  The ARM architecture number passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.

CONFIG_DRIVER_NAND (y/n)

  Include a region IO driver for NAND flash.

CONFIG_DRIVER_NOR (y/n)

  Include a region IO driver for NOR flash.

CONFIG_RELOCATE_NAND (y/n)

  Use an APEX relocator that will copy the loader from NAND flash
  instead of relocating it where it starts.  Normally, the loader
  copies itself from NOR flash with a simple memory to memory copy.
  NAND flash requires greater support to move the loader from flash to
  SDRAM.

CONFIG_NAND_LPD (y/n)

  Directly support the LogicPD NAND flash control features.  The
  LogicPD CPLD has slightly control over NAND flash than a bare chip.
  Use this options when building for one of the LPD CardEngines. 

CONFIG_ENV_AUTOBOOT (number)

  Time, in tenths of a second, to let the user intervene before
  automatically autobooting.  A value of zero will perform a boot
  command without letting the user an opportunite to intervene.
  Without this option, the loader will only boot interactively.

CONFIG_ENV_REGION_KERNEL (string)

  String describing the IO region where the kernel is stored.  If this
  parameter is present and if there is a CONFIG_KERNEL_VMA, then the
  startup string will include a command to copy the kernel from this
  region to the VMA address.  Usually, it is something like
  
  CONFIG_ENV_REGION_KERNEL=nor:256k#1536k
